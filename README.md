##Landing page for my First React Native App. 

I did this project mainly to familiarize myself with React Native, but also to practice my React skills.

You can check mobile app code in the folder Native_App


During this project I gain knowledge about:
    
 - React Native
 - Tailwind
 - Web 3.0

```
Project was made on JS Mastery classes on YouTube
